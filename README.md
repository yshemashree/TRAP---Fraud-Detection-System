FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM
OVERVIEW
The Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based application designed to analyze financial transactions and predict fraudulent activities. It utilizes an anomaly detection model and integrates with a Gradio interface to provide real-time fraud detection.

FEATURES
Real-time Fraud Detection: Instantly checks transactions for anomalies.

Machine Learning-Based Analysis: Uses a trained model to predict fraudulent behavior.

User-Friendly Interface: Integrated with Gradio for ease of use.

Continuous Learning: Updates its knowledge base with new data.

Scalable & Efficient: Optimized for fast predictions with minimal latency.

TECHNOLOHY USED
Python

TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM-based anomaly detection

Scikit-Learn for Isolation Forest Model

Pandas & NumPy for data processing

Gradio for UI/UX interaction

Google Colab/VS Code for execution and development

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The system consists of the following components:

Data Preprocessing: Converts transaction details into numerical values.

Model Prediction: Analyzes transaction patterns for anomalies.

User Interface: Accepts inputs and displays fraud predictions.

Continuous Learning: Updates model with new transaction data.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP
Running in Google Colab

Open Google Colab and upload the project files.

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application
python app.py

Usage Instructions

Enter transaction details (Date, Amount, Location) in the Gradio UI.

Click 'Detect Fraud' to analyze the transaction.

View results: The system will display if the transaction is safe ✅ or fraudulent 🚨.

New data is logged, and the model updates periodically for improved accuracy.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
Integration with Real-Time APIs (e.g., Google Pay, PayPal transactions)

More Advanced Deep Learning Models for fraud detection

Automated Model Retraining for continuous learning
