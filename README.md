<h1>FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM</h1>



<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

The Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based application designed to analyze financial transactions and predict fraudulent activities. It utilizes an anomaly detection model and integrates with a Gradio interface to provide real-time fraud detection.



<h2>FEATURES</h2>

Real-time Fraud Detection: Instantly checks transactions for anomalies.

Machine Learning-Based Analysis: Uses a trained model to predict fraudulent behavior.

User-Friendly Interface: Integrated with Gradio for ease of use.

Continuous Learning: Updates its knowledge base with new data.

Scalable & Efficient: Optimized for fast predictions with minimal latency.




<h2>TECHNOLOHY USED</h2>

Python

TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM-based anomaly detection

Scikit-Learn for Isolation Forest Model

Pandas & NumPy for data processing

Gradio for UI/UX interaction

Google Colab/VS Code for execution and development




<h2>SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE</h2>

The system consists of the following components:

Data Preprocessing: Converts transaction details into numerical values.

Model Prediction: Analyzes transaction patterns for anomalies.

User Interface: Accepts inputs and displays fraud predictions.

Continuous Learning: Updates model with new transaction data.

<h2>INSTALLATION AND SETUP</h2>

Running in Google Colab

Open Google Colab and upload the project files.


<h2>INSTALL DEPENDENCIES</h2>

<h3>Install required packages:</h3>

pip install -r requirements.txt

<h2>Run the application</h2>

python app.py

Usage Instructions

Enter transaction details (Date, Amount, Location) in the Gradio UI.

Click 'Detect Fraud' to analyze the transaction.

View results: The system will display if the transaction is safe âœ… or fraudulent ðŸš¨.

New data is logged, and the model updates periodically for improved accuracy.




<h2>FUTURE ENHANCEMENT</h2>

Integration with Real-Time APIs (e.g., Google Pay, PayPal transactions)

More Advanced Deep Learning Models for fraud detection

Automated Model Retraining for continuous learning

Cloud Deployment for scalability
